      <h3 id="parsing_usingdtd">Using the MathML DTD</h3>
      
      
                
         <p>The MathML DTD uses the strategy outlined in
           [[Modularization]] to allow the use of namespace prefixes
           on MathML eelements. However it is recommended that
           namespace prefixes are not used in XML serialisation of
           MathML, for compatibility with the HTML serialisation.</p>
         
               
         <p>Furthermore, the MathML DTD is provided for convenience; although it is
            intended to be fully compatible with the text of the specification, the
            text should be taken as definitive if there is a contradiction.  (Any
            contradictions which may exist between various chapters of the text should
            be resolved by favoring <a href="#chars"></a> first, then <a href="#presm"></a>, <a href="#contm"></a>, then <a href="#fund_syntax"></a>,
            and then other parts of the text.)</p>
         
      
         <p>MathML documents should be validated using the XML DTD for
            MathML,
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml4/mathml4.dtd">http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml4/mathml4.dtd</a>.
            </p> 
         
         
         <p>Documents using this DTD should contain a DOCTYPE declaration
            of the form:
            
            <div class="example ">
               <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE math 
    PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD MathML 4.0//EN"
           "http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml4/mathml4.dtd"&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            The URI may be changed to that of a local copy
         of the DTD if required.</p>

	 <p>Note that unlike the HTML serialization, when using the
	 XML serialization, character entity references such as
	 <code>&amp;int</code> may not be used unless a DTD is
	 specified, either the full MathML DTD as described here or the
         set of HTML/MathML entity declarations as specified by [[Entities].
	 Characters may always be specified by using character data directly, or numeric character referencess, so
	 <code>âˆ«</code> or <code>&amp;#x222B;</code> rather than
	 <code>&amp;int;</code>.</p>

      <h3 id="parsing_usingxsd">Using the MathML XML Schema</h3>
      
      
      
      
      <p>MathML fragments can be validated using the XML Schema for MathML,
         located at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/XMLSchema/mathml4/mathml4.xsd">http://www.w3.org/Math/XMLSchema/mathml4/mathml4.xsd</a>. The
         provided schema  has been mechanically generated from the Relax NG schema, it omits
         some constraints that can not be enforced using XSD syntax.</p>
