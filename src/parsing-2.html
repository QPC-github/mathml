         <p>The MathML DTD uses the strategy outlined in
           [[Modularization]] to allow the use of namespace prefixes
           on MathML elements. However it is recommended that
           namespace prefixes are not used in XML serialisation of
           MathML, for compatibility with the HTML serialisation.</p>
                 
         
	 <p>Note that unlike the HTML serialization, when using the
	 XML serialization, character entity references such as
	 <code>&amp;int</code> may not be used unless a DTD is
	 specified, either the full MathML DTD as described here or the
         set of HTML/MathML entity declarations as specified by [[xml-entity-names].
	 Characters may always be specified by using character data directly, or numeric character references, so
	 <code>âˆ«</code> or <code>&amp;#x222B;</code> rather than
	 <code>&amp;int;</code>.</p>

      <p>MathML fragments can be validated using the XML Schema for MathML,
         located at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/XMLSchema/mathml4/mathml4.xsd">http://www.w3.org/Math/XMLSchema/mathml4/mathml4.xsd</a>. The
         provided schema  has been mechanically generated from the Relax NG schema, it omits
         some constraints that can not be enforced using XSD syntax.</p>
