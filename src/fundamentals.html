         <h4 id="fund_xmlsyntax">Children versus Arguments</h4>
         <p>Most MathML elements act as &#x2018;containers&#x2019;; such an element's 
children are not distinguished from each other except as individual members of the 
list of children.  Commonly there is no limit imposed on the number of children
an element may have.  This is the case for most presentation
elements and some content elements such as </p>
         <p>There are presentation elements that conceptually accept only
a single argument, but which for convenience have been written to accept any number of children;
then we infer an </p>
         <p>In the detailed discussions of element syntax given with each
element throughout the MathML specification, the correspondence
of children with arguments, the number of arguments required and
their order, as well as other constraints on the content, are specified.
This information is also tabulated
for the presentation elements in </p>

         <h4 id="fund_renderingmodel">MathML and Rendering</h4>
         <p>MathML presentation elements only recommend (i.e., do not require)
specific ways of rendering; this is in order to allow for medium-dependent
rendering and for individual preferences of style.</p>
         <p>Nevertheless, some parts of this specification describe these
recommended visual rendering rules in detail; in those
descriptions it is often assumed that the model of rendering
used supports the concepts of a well-defined 'current rendering
environment' which, in particular, specifies a 'current font',
a 'current display' (for pixel size) and a 'current baseline'.
The 'current font' provides certain metric properties and an
encoding of glyphs.</p>

the meaning or effect of the element. Attribute names are shown in a

            <p>To  describe  the  MathML-specific  syntax  of 
attribute values, the  following conventions and notations are
used for most attributes in the present document.  
We use below the notation
beginning with U+ that is recommended by Unicode

used for MathML's basic schema, </p>
            <p>Since some applications are inconsistent about normalization
of whitespace, for maximum interoperability it is advisable to use only
a single whitespace character for separating parts of a value.
Moreover, leading and trailing whitespace in attribute values should be avoided.</p>
            <p>For most numerical attributes, only those in a subset of the
expressible values are sensible; values outside this subset are not
errors, unless otherwise specified, but rather are rounded up or down
(at the discretion of the renderer) to the closest value within the
allowed subset.  The set of allowed values may depend on the renderer,
and is not specified by MathML.</p>

specifies whether the enclosed MathML expression should be rendered
as a separate vertical block (in display style)
or inline, aligned with adjacent text.
When <code class="attribute">display</code>=<code class="attributevalue">block</code>, <code class="attribute">displaystyle</code> is initialized 
to <code class="attributevalue">true</code>,
whereas when <code class="attribute">display</code>=<code class="attributevalue">inline</code>, <code class="attribute">displaystyle</code> 
is initialized to <code class="attributevalue">false</code>;
in both cases <code class="attribute">scriptlevel</code> is initialized to 0
(See <a href="#presm_scriptlevel"/>).
Moreover, when the math element is embedded in a larger document,
a block math element should be treated as a block element as appropriate
for the document type (typically as a new vertical block),
whereas an inline math element should be treated as inline
(typically exactly as if it were a sequence of words in normal text).
In particular, this applies to spacing and linebreaking: for instance,
there should not be spaces or line breaks inserted between inline math
and any immediately following punctuation.
When the display attribute is missing, a rendering agent is free to initialize
as appropriate to the context.

      <h3 id="interf_genproc">Conformance</h3>
      <p>Information nowadays is commonly 
generated, processed and rendered by
software tools. The exponential growth of the Web is fueling the
development of advanced systems for automatically searching,
categorizing, and interconnecting information. 
In addition, there are increasing numbers of
Web services, some of which offer technically based materials
and activities. Thus, although MathML
can be written by hand and read by humans,
whether machine-aided or just with much concentration, 
the future of MathML is
largely tied to the ability to process it with software tools.</p>
      <p>There are many different kinds of MathML 
processors: editors for authoring MathML expressions, translators for
converting to and from other encodings, validators for checking MathML
expressions, computation engines that evaluate, manipulate, or compare
MathML expressions, and rendering engines that produce visual, aural,
or tactile representations of mathematical notation.  What it
means to support MathML varies widely between applications.  For
example, the issues that arise with a  validating
parser are very different from those for an equation
editor.</p>
      <p>This section gives guidelines that describe different types
of MathML support and make clear the extent of MathML support in
a given application.  Developers, users, and reviewers are encouraged
to use these guidelines in characterizing products.  The intention
behind these guidelines is to facilitate reuse by
and interoperability
of MathML applications by accurately setting out their
capabilities in quantifiable terms.</p>

         <h4 id="fund_mathmlconf">MathML Conformance</h4>
         <p>A valid MathML expression is an XML construct determined by the MathML
RelaxNG Schema together with the additional requirements given in this specification.</p>
         <p>We shall use the phrase </p>
         <p>Three forms of MathML conformance are specified:
</p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>A MathML-input-conformant processor must
accept all valid MathML expressions; it should appropriately translate all
MathML expressions into application-specific form allowing native
application operations to be performed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>A MathML-output-conformant processor must
generate valid MathML, appropriately representing all
application-specific data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>A MathML-round-trip-conformant processor must
preserve MathML equivalence. Two MathML expressions are

            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>Beyond the above definitions, the MathML specification makes no
demands of individual processors.  In order to guide developers, the
MathML specification includes advisory material; for example, there
are many recommended rendering rules throughout </p>
         <p>To clarify the difference between conformance and
interpretation of what is meaningful, consider some examples:
</p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>In order 
to be MathML-input-conformant, a
validating parser needs only to accept expressions, and return
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>A MathML computer-algebra interface based on content markup
might choose to ignore all presentation markup. Provided the interface
accepts all valid MathML expressions including those containing
presentation markup, it would be technically correct to characterize
the application as MathML-input-conformant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>An equation editor might have an internal data representation
that makes it easy to export some equations as MathML but not
others. If the editor exports the simple equations as valid MathML,
and merely displays an error message to the effect that conversion
failed for the others, it is still technically
MathML-output-conformant.</p>

            <h5 id="interf_testsuite">MathML Test Suite and Validator</h5>
            <p>As the previous examples show, to be useful, the concept of MathML
conformance frequently involves a judgment about what parts of the
language are meaningfully implemented, as opposed to parts that are
merely processed in a technically correct way with respect to the
definitions of conformance.  This requires some mechanism for giving a
quantitative statement about which parts of MathML are meaningfully
implemented by a given application.  To this end, the W3C Math Working
Group has provided a </p>
            <p>The test suite consists of a large number of MathML expressions
categorized by markup category and dominant MathML element being
tested.  The existence of this test suite makes it possible, for example,
to characterize quantitatively the hypothetical computer algebra interface
mentioned above by saying that it is a MathML-input-conformant processor
which meaningfully implements MathML content markup, including all of
the expressions in the content markup section of the test suite.</p>
            <p>Developers who choose not to implement parts of the MathML
specification in a meaningful way are encouraged to itemize the parts
they leave out by referring to specific categories in the test suite.</p>
            <p>For MathML-output-conformant processors, information about currently 
available tools to validate MathML is
maintained at the </p>
            <p>Customers of MathML applications who wish to verify claims as to which
parts of the MathML specification are implemented by an application are
encouraged to use the test suites as a part of their decision

            <p>MathML 3.0 contains a number of features of earlier MathML
which are now deprecated.  The following points define what it means for a
feature to be deprecated, and clarify the relation between
deprecated features and  current MathML conformance.</p>

               <li>
                  <p>In order to be MathML-output-conformant, authoring tools may not
generate MathML markup containing deprecated features.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>In order to be MathML-input-conformant, rendering and reading
tools must support deprecated features if they are to be 
in conformance with MathML 1.x or MathML 2.x.   They do not have to support deprecated
features to be considered in conformance with MathML 3.0.  However, all tools
are encouraged to support the old forms as much as
possible.</p>

 Extension Mechanisms and Conformance</h5>
            <p>MathML 3.0 defines three basic extension mechanisms:  the </p>
            <p>These extension mechanisms are important because they provide a way
of encoding concepts that are beyond the scope of MathML 3.0 as presently 
explicitly specified, which
allows MathML to be used for exploring new ideas not yet susceptible
to standardization.  However, as new ideas take hold, they may become
part of future standards.  For example, an emerging character that
must be represented by an </p>
            <p>Because the possibility of future obsolescence is inherent in the
use of extension mechanisms to facilitate the discussion of new ideas,
MathML can reasonably make 
no conformance requirements concerning the use of
extension mechanisms, even when alternative standard markup is
available.  For example, using an </p>

         <h4 id="interf_unspecified">Attributes for unspecified data</h4>
         <p>The MathML attributes described in the MathML specification are
intended to allow for good presentation and content markup. However
it is never possible to cover all users' needs for markup. Ideally, the MathML
attributes should be an open-ended list so that users can add specific
attributes for specific renderers. However, this cannot be done within
the confines of a single XML DTD or in a Schema. 
Although it can be done using extensions of the standard DTD, say,
some authors will wish to use non-standard
attributes to take advantage of renderer-specific capabilities while
remaining strictly in conformance with the standard
DTD.</p>
         <p>To allow this, the MathML 1.0 specification </p>

development of a general XML namespace mechanism
