<p>As an essential element of the Open Web Platform, the W3C MathML
specification has the unprecedented potential to enable content
authors and developers to incorporate mathematical expressions on the
web in such a way that the underlying structural and semantic
information can be exposed to other technologies. Enabling this
information exposure is foundational for accessibility, as well as
providing a path for making digital mathematics content machine
readable, searchable and reusable.</p>

<p>The internationally accepted standards and underpinning principles
for creating accessible digital content on the web can be found in the
W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  [[WCAG21]]. In
extending these principles to digital content containing mathematical
information, WCAG provides a useful framework for defining
accessibility wherever MathML is used.</p>

<p>As the current WCAG guidelines provide no direct guidance on how to
ensure mathematical content encoded as MathML will be accessible to
users with disabilities, this specification
defines how to apply these guidelines to
digital content containing MathML.</p>

<p>A benefit of following this recommendation is that it
helps to ensure that digital mathematics content meets the
accessibility requirements already widely used around the world for
web content. In addition, ensuring that digital mathematics materials
are accessible will expand the readership of such content to both
readers with and without disabilities.</p>


<p>Further requirements are given in [[?MathML-Notes]]
to allow them to adapt and evolve independent of the
MathML specification â€” accessibility practices often need more
frequent updating. The Notes are also intended
for use with past, present, and future versions of MathML, in addition
to considerations for both the MathML-Core and the full MathML
specification. The approach of a separate document ensures that
the evolution of MathML does not lock accessibility in time, and
allows content authors to apply the most recent accessibility
requirements.</p>
