      <p>Robert Miner, whose leadership and contributions were essential
to the development of the Math Working Group and MathML from their
beginnings, died tragically young in December 2011.</p>
      <p>Participants in the Working Group responsible for MathML 3.0 have been:
</p>
      <p>
All the above persons have been members of the currently chartered Math Working Group, but some not for the whole life of the Working Group.  The 22 authors listed for MathML3 at the start of this specification are those who contributed 
reworkings and reformulations used in the actual text of the specification. 
Thus the list includes the principal authors of MathML2 much of whose text was repurposed here.  They were, of course, supported and encouraged by the activity and discussions of the whole Math Working Group, and by helpful commentary from outside it, both within the W3C and further afield.

For 2003 to 2006 W3C Math Activity comprised a Math Interest Group,
chaired by David Carlisle of NAG and Robert Miner of Design Science.

      <p>
The W3C Math Working Group (2001&#x2013;2003)
 was co-chaired by Patrick Ion of the
AMS, and Angel Diaz of IBM from June 2001 to May 2002; afterwards
Patrick Ion continued as chair until the end of the WG's extended charter.

      <p>Participants in the Working Group responsible for MathML 2.0, second
edition were:

      <p>The Working Group benefited from the help of many other
people in developing the specification for MathML 1.0. We
would like to particularly name Barbara Beeton, Chris Hamlin,
John Jenkins, Ira Polans, Arthur Smith, Robby Villegas and Joe
Yurvati for help and information in assembling the character
tables in </p>
      <p>
As the Math Working Group went on to MathML 2.0, it again was
helped by many from the W3C family of Working Groups with whom
we necessarily had a great deal of interaction.  Outside the
W3C, a particularly active relevant front was the interface
with the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) and the NTSC WG2
dealing with ISO 10646.  There the STIX project put together a
proposal for the addition of characters for mathematical
notation to Unicode, and this work was again </p>
