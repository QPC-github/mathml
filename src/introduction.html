      <h3 id="intro_notation">Mathematics and its Notation</h3>
      <p>A distinguishing feature of mathematics is the use of a complex and
highly evolved system of two-dimensional symbolic notation.  As
J.&#xa0;R.&#xa0;Pierce writes in his book on communication theory,
mathematics and its notation should not be viewed as one and the same
thing </p>
      <p>Mathematical notation evolves constantly as people continue
to innovate in ways of approaching and expressing ideas. Even
the common notation of arithmetic has gone through an amazing
variety of styles, including many defunct ones advocated by leading
mathematical figures of their day </p>
      <p>Notational conventions in mathematics, and in printed text in general,
guide the eye and make printed expressions much easier to read and
understand. Though we usually take them for granted, we, as modern readers,
rely on 
numerous conventions such as paragraphs, capital letters, font
families and cases, and even the device of decimal-like numbering of
sections such as is used in this document.  
Such notational conventions are perhaps even more important
for electronic media, where one must contend with the difficulties of
on-screen reading.  Appropriate standards coupled with computers
enable a broadening of access to mathematics beyond the world of 
print. The markup methods for mathematics in use 
just before the Web rose to prominence importantly included T</p>
      <p>It is remarkable how widespread the current
conventions of mathematical notation have become. The general
two-dimensional layout, and most of the same symbols, are used
in all modern mathematical communications,
whether the participants are, say, European, writing left-to-right,
or Middle-Eastern, writing right-to-left.  Of course, conventions
for the symbols used, particularly those naming functions and
variables, may tend to favor a local language and script.
The largest variation from the most common is a form used in
some Arabic-speaking communities which lays out the entire
mathematical notation from right-to-left, roughly in mirror image
of the European tradition.</p>
      <p>However, there is more to putting mathematics on the Web
than merely finding ways of displaying traditional
mathematical notation in a Web browser. The Web represents a
fundamental change in the underlying metaphor for knowledge
storage, a change in which </p>

         <h4 id="intro_goals">Design Goals of MathML</h4>
         <p>MathML  has   been  designed  from the beginning with  the  following
ultimate goals in mind.</p>
         <p>MathML should ideally:
</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>Encode mathematical material suitable for all educational
and scientific communication.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Encode both mathematical notation and mathematical meaning.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Facilitate conversion to and from other mathematical
formats, both presentational and semantic. Output formats should include:
</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>graphical displays</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>speech synthesizers</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>input for computer algebra systems</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>other mathematics typesetting languages, such as T</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>plain text displays, e.g. VT100 emulators</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>international print media, including braille</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
</p>
               <p>It is recognized that conversion to and from other notational
systems or media may entail loss of information in the process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Allow the passing of information intended for
specific renderers and applications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Support efficient browsing of lengthy expressions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Provide for extensibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Be well suited to templates and other common techniques for editing formulas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Be legible to humans, and simple for software to generate and process.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>No matter how successfully  MathML achieves its goals as
a markup language, it is clear that MathML is useful only
if it is  implemented well. The W3C Math Working
Group has identified a short list of additional implementation
goals. These  goals attempt to describe  concisely the minimal
functionality MathML rendering  and processing software should
try to provide.
</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>MathML expressions in HTML (and XHTML) pages should render
properly in popular Web browsers, in accordance with reader and author
viewing preferences, and at the highest quality possible given the
capabilities of the platform.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>HTML (and XHTML) documents containing MathML expressions should
print properly and at high-quality printer resolutions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>MathML expressions in Web pages  should be able to  react to
user  gestures, such those as  with a  mouse,  and to coordinate
communication  with  other applications through   the
browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Mathematical expression editors and converters should be developed
to facilitate the creation of Web pages containing MathML
expressions.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>The extent to which these goals are ultimately met depends on the
cooperation and support of browser vendors and other developers. The W3C
Math Working Group has continued to work with other working groups of the W3C,
and outside the W3C, to ensure that the
needs of the scientific community will be met.
MathML 2 and its implementations showed considerable progress in this area 
over the situation that obtained at
the time of the MathML 1.0 Recommendation (April 1998) </p>

The quadratic formula provides a 
simple but instructive illustration of MathML markup.

      <ing src="image/f1002.gif" alt="x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}"/>
      <p>MathML offers two flavors of markup of this formula.  The first is
the style which emphasizes the actual presentation of a formula, the 
two-dimensional layout in which the symbols are arranged. An example 
of this type is given just below. The second flavor
emphasizes the mathematical content and an example of it follows the first one.

Consider the superscript 2 in this formula.  It represents the squaring operation
here, but the meaning of a superscript in other situations depends on
the context.  A letter with a superscript can be used to signify a particular 
component of a vector, or maybe the superscript just labels a different 
type of some structure.  Similarly two letters written one just after the 
other could signify two variables multiplied together, as they do in the 
quadratic formula, or they could be two letters making up the name of a 
single variable.   What is called Content Markup in MathML allows closer
specification of the mathematical meaning of many common formulas.  The
quadratic formula given in this style of markup is as follows.
