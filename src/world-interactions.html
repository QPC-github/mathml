      <p>To be effective, MathML must work well with a wide variety of
renderers, processors, translators and editors. This chapter raises
some of the interface issues involved in generating and rendering
MathML. Since MathML exists primarily to encode mathematics in Web
documents, perhaps the most important interface issues relate to
embedding MathML in </p>
      <p>There are three kinds of interface issues that arise in embedding
MathML in other XML documents. First, MathML markup must be recognized
as valid embedded XML
content, and not as an error.  This issue could be seen primarily as a
question of managing namespaces in XML </p>
      <p>Second, in the case of HTML/XHTML, MathML rendering must be
integrated with browser software.  Some browsers already implement
MathML rendering natively, and one can expect more browsers will do so
in the future.  At the same time, other browsers
have developed infrastructure to facilitate the rendering of MathML
and other embedded XML content by third-party software or other
built-in technology.  Examples of this built-in technology are the
sophisticated CSS rendering engines now available, and the powerful
implementations of JavaScript/ECMAScript that are becoming
common. Using these browser-specific mechanisms generally requires
additional interface markup of some sort to activate them.  In the
case of CSS, there is a special restricted form of MathML3
</p>
      <p>Third, other tools for generating and processing MathML must be
able to communicate.  A number of MathML tools have been or are
being developed, including editors, translators, computer algebra
systems, and other scientific software.  However, since MathML
expressions tend to be lengthy, and prone to error when entered by
hand, special emphasis must be made to ensure that MathML can easily
be generated by user-friendly conversion and authoring tools, and
that these tools work together in a dependable, platform-independent,
and vendor-independent way.</p>

         <p>Markup-language specifications that wish to embed MathML may require
special conditions to recognize MathML markup that are independent of
this recommendation.  The conditions should be similar to those expressed
in this recommendation, and the local names of the MathML elements should
remain the same as those defined in this recommendation.</p>

         <p>Although rendering MathML expressions often takes place in
a Web browser, other MathML processing functions take place more
naturally in other applications.  Particularly common tasks include
opening a MathML expression in an equation editor or computer algebra
system.  It is important therefore to specify the encoding names
by which MathML fragments should be identified.</p>

      <p>MathML expressions are often exchanged between applications using the
familiar copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop paradigms and are often stored
in files or exchanged over the HTTP protocol.  This section provides
recommended ways to process MathML during these transfers.</p>

the contexts of two applications by making the MathML data available in
several flavors, often called </p>

depending on the platform.  HTTP transfers are all based on media types.

         <h4 id="world-int-transf-recommend">Recommended Behaviors when Transferring</h4>
         <p>An application that transfers MathML markup SHOULD adhere to the following
conventions:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>An application that supports pure presentation markup and/or pure
content markup SHOULD offer as many of these flavors as it has available.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>An application that only exports one MathML flavor SHOULD name it
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
If an application is able to determine a more specific flavor, it SHOULD
offer both the generic and specific transfer flavors, but it SHOULD only
deliver the specific flavor if it knows that the recipient supports it.
For an HTTP GET transfer, for example, the specific transfer types for
content and presentation markup should only be returned if they are
included in the the HTTP </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
An application that exports the two specific transfer flavors SHOULD
export both the content and presentation transfer flavors, as well as
the generic flavor, which SHOULD combine the other two flavors using
a top-level MathML </p>
            </li>

root element is a </p>

         <p>To determine whether a MathML instance is pure content markup or
pure presentation markup, the </p>
         <p>It is worth noting that the above recommendations allow agents
that produce MathML to provide binary data for the clipboard, for

         <p>While the above recommendations are intended to improve
interoperability between MathML-aware applications that use these
transfer paradigms, it should be noted that they do not guarantee
interoperability.  For example, references to external resources
(e.g. stylesheets, etc.) in MathML data can cause interoperability
problems if the consumer of the data is unable to locate them,
as can happen when cutting and pasting HTML or other data types.
An application that makes use of references to external resources
is encouraged to make users aware of potential problems and provide
alternate ways to obtain the referenced resources.  In general,
consumers of MathML data that contains references they cannot
resolve or do not understand should ignore the external references.

            <p>An e-Learning application has a database of quiz questions, some of
  which contain MathML.  The MathML comes from multiple sources, and the
  e-Learning application merely passes the data on for display, but does
  not have sophisticated MathML analysis capabilities.  Consequently,
  the application is not aware whether a given MathML instance is pure
  presentation or pure content markup, nor does it know whether the

      <h3 id="world-int-combine-other">Combining MathML and Other Formats</h3>
      <p>MathML is usually used in combination with other markup languages.
The most typical case is perhaps the use of MathML within a
document-level markup language, such as </p>
      <p>Most document markup languages have some concept of an inline
equation, (or graphic, object, etc.) so there is a typically a natural
 way to incorporate MathML instances into the content
model.  However, in the other direction, embedding of markup within
MathML is not so clear cut, since in many MathML elements, the role of
child elements is defined by position.  For example, the first
child of an </p>
      <p>For this reason, the default MathML schema does not allow
foreign markup elements to be included within MathML
instances.</p>
      <p>In the standard schema, elements from other namespaces
are not allowed, but attributes from other namespaces are permitted.
MathML processors that encounter unknown XML markup should behave
as follows:
</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>An attribute from a non-MathML namespace should be silently ignored.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>An element from a non-MathML namespace should be treated
    as an error, except in an </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
   
For example, if the second child of an </p>
      <p>When designing a compound document format in which MathML is included in a larger document type, the designer may extend the content model of MathML to allow additional elements. For example, a common extension is to extend the MathML schema such that elements from non-MathML namespaces are
allowed in token elements, but not in other elements. MathML processors that
encounter unknown markup should behave as follows:
</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>An unrecognized XML attribute should be silently ignored.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>An unrecognized element in a MathML token element should be silently ignored.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>An element from a non-MathML namespace should be treated
    as an error, except in an </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
</p>
      <p>Extending the schema in this way is easily achieved using the Relax NG schema described in </p>
      <p>Considerations about mixing markup vocabularies in compound
documents arise when a compound document type is first designed.
But once the document type is fixed, it is not generally practical
for specific software tools to further modify the content model to
suit their needs.
However, it is still frequently the case that such tools may need to

      <h3 id="world-int-style">Using CSS with MathML</h3>
      <p>When MathML is rendered in an environment that supports CSS </p>
      <p>Generally speaking, the model for CSS interaction with the math
style attributes runs as follows.  A CSS style sheet might provide a style
rule such as:</p>
      <pre>
math *.[mathsize="small"] {
  font-size: 80%
}
</pre>
      <p>This rule sets the CSS font-size </p>
      <p>It should be stressed, however, that some caution is required in
writing CSS stylesheets for MathML.  Because changing typographic
properties of mathematics symbols can change the meaning of an equation,
stylesheets should be written in a way such that changes to document-wide
typographic styles do not affect embedded MathML expressions.</p>
      <p>Another pitfall to be avoided is using CSS to provide
typographic style information necessary to the proper understanding of
an expression.
Expressions dependent on CSS for meaning will not be
portable to non-CSS environments such as computer algebra systems.  By
using the logical values of the new MathML 3.0 mathematics style attributes
as selectors for CSS rules, it can be assured that style information
necessary to the sense of an expression is encoded directly in the
MathML.</p>
      <p>MathML 3.0 does not specify how a user agent should process style
information, because there are many non-CSS MathML environments, and
because different users agents and renderers have widely varying
degrees of access to CSS information.</p>
      <section>
         <h4>Order of processing attributes versus style sheets</h4>
         <p>CSS or analogous style sheets can specify changes to rendering
properties of selected MathML elements.  Since rendering properties
can also be changed by attributes on an element, or be changed
automatically by the renderer, it is necessary to specify the order in
which changes requested by various sources should occur.
The order is defined by </p>
