 <p>Presented here are Relax NG schema for MathML.
 A Relax NG Schema is most naturally associated with the XML serialization
 of MathML, but may also form the basis of  validation in other
 formats such as HTML5.</p>
 <p>Even when using the XML serialization, some normalization of
 the input may be required before applying these schema, Notably,
 following HTML, [[MathML-Core]] allows attributes such as
 <code>onclick</code> to be specified in any case, eg
 <code>OnClick="..."</code>
 It is not practically feasible to specify that attribute names are
 case insensitive here so only the lowercase names are allowed.
 Similarly any attribute with name starting with the prefix
 <code>data-</code> should be considered valid. The schema here only
 allows a fixed attribute, <code>data-extra</code>, so input should be
 normalized to remove data attributes before validating, or the schema
 should be extended to support th attributes used in a particular
 application.</p>
